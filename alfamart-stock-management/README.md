## Object-Oriented Design

### Class Hierarchy

├── Category
├── Supplier
├── Product
└── StockTransaction
    ├── StockInTransaction
    ├── StockOutTransaction
    └── StockAdjustmentTransaction
```

### Design Principles Applied

1. **Encapsulation**
   - Private attributes with controlled access
   - Data validation in setter methods
   - Internal state protection

2. **Inheritance**
   - Base classes for common functionality
   - Specialized transaction types
   - Mixin classes for interface implementation

3. **Polymorphism**
   - Method overriding in transaction types
   - Dynamic method dispatch
   - Interface-based programming

4. **Abstraction**
   - Abstract base classes
   - Interface definitions
   - Implementation hiding

### Key Classes

#### BaseEntityMixin
Provides common functionality for all entities:
- `to_dict()`: Serialization
- `validate()`: Data validation

#### Product
Demonstrates complex business logic:
- Stock operations (add, reduce, check availability)
- Price calculations (profit margin, stock value)
- Status management (active/inactive, stock levels)

#### StockTransaction
Implements polymorphism:
- Base transaction functionality
- Specialized behavior for different transaction types
- Factory pattern for creation
